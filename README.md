# GoProFileRenamer
An easy to understand bashscript that renames the files that GoPros create in their amazing default filenames

Renames Gabbcccc.MP4 to G-cccc-a-bb.MP4

I take no liablity for any damages caused by the script. Use at own risk.

(the mv command should be the only potentially destructive command)
